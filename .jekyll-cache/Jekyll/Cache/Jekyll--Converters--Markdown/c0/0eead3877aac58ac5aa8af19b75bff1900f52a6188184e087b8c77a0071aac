<p>How to Borderlands 2 Japanese Voiceover/Dub with English subtitle. This folder only contain JP audio only, and part of The Handsome Collection.</p>

<h1 id="assume-you-are-already-unpackunzip-this-folder-at-the-time-of-reading-this">Assume you are already unpack/unzip this folder at the time of reading this.</h1>
<p><br />
Copy all the FOLDERS (select all, EXCEPT Japanese folder)
and paste inside your Borderlands 2 DLC folder
<code class="highlighter-rouge">..\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Borderlands 2\DLC</code>
<br />
Copy ONLY Japanese folder and paste inside CookedPCConsole
<code class="highlighter-rouge">..\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Borderlands 2\WillowGame\CookedPCConsole</code>
<br />
Copy WillowEngine.ini file and paste inside your local game directory</p>

<p>TIP: You can make a BACKUP your current .ini by just rename it to something like
<code class="highlighter-rouge">WillowEngine-backup.ini</code> in case you want to revert it back later
<code class="highlighter-rouge">C:\Users\&lt;your username&gt;\Documents\My Games\Borderlands 2\WillowGame\Config</code>
<br /></p>
<h1 id="ps-and-question">PS and Question:</h1>
<p>(*)-<code class="highlighter-rouge">WillowEngine.ini</code> changes the default voiceover/dub inside the game.
<br />
(?)-Will this work if I only have the base game and <code class="highlighter-rouge">The Season Pass</code>?</p>

<p>(+)-It should work though. The season pass is just bundled dlc afaik.
You can try it.
<br />
(?)-Will this work if I have mod installed?</p>

<p>(+)-I don’t know, I’m not playing with mod. You can try it.
<br />
(?)-How I revert back to English dub?</p>

<p>(+)-Try delete the <code class="highlighter-rouge">WillowEngine.ini</code>, and rename the backup file. If it didn’t
work, try to Verify the game file in Steam. Expect 1.5GiB file re-download.
It will re-download english dub.
